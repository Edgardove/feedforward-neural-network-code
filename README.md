# Feedforward neural network Python code example

**Using ***backpropagation*** as the training algorithm, this simple code shows an accuracy of 90%.**

**I used the dataset at <https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/optical+recognition+of+handwritten+digits>.**

**The transfer function used is ***softmax*** and the loss is ***cross entropy*** loss.**

**The main file is the index.py and it has descriptive comments about its use.**
